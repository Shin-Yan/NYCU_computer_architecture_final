# Computer Architecture final project

Install: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Shin-Yan/NYCU_computer_architecture_final.git
```
Compile:
```
// In developing mode, use make
$ make

// In Virtual Machine to test the code, use make vm
$ make vm
```

Execution: Note that gpu_version2 is just for debugging on your computer, it can't actually access the CUDA device.
```
// In developing mode
$ ./gpu_version2

// In Virtual Machine
$ ./gpu_vm2
```
